Unsupervised Learning:

a.Clustering:
Group similar points together.
b.Anomaly detection:
Find unusual data points.
c.Dimensionality reduction:
Compress data using fewer number.

Example of unsupervised learning algorithm:
given a data set of news articles found on the web ,group them into sets of articles about the same story.
given a database of costumer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers
into different market segments.

SUPERVISED LEARNING MODELS:
1.REGRESSION MODEL:
Predict numbers.(house price etc..)
Infinetly many possible ouyputs.

2.CLASSIFICATION MODEL:
Predict Categories.(dog or cat)
Small number of possible outputs.

Training set: Data used to train the model.
Notation:
x="input" variable feature
y="output" or "target" variable
m=number of training examples
